# THE DOS AND DONT'S OF MANAGING CONFLICT

- Don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting.
- Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions
 - To allow for group decision making, the groups need to have a clear set of standards that they use
to evaluate decisions.
 - Shared understading of the goals, risks, and the questions to answer before making a decision.
- Don't turn a blind eye to simmering issues
 - IF there are major problems with someone's work, that person should know ASAP
