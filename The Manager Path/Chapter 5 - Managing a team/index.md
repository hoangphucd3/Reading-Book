The role of managing a team, which is called "engineering lead":
- Spend less time writing code, but still engage in small technical deliverables, such as bug fixes or small features
- Identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks and clearing these roadblocks
- Communicating expectations clearly to all members, and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently

The work of supporting people was far more important to management success.

To command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as technically credible.
Of course, you have to learn how to balance.

Stay technical until you feel that you have truly mastered what you want to learn for writing code
and designing system.
