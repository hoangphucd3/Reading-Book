# RULES OF THUMB

## Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board
Testing, debugging, cleaning up the legacy code, migrating language or platform versions...
Cleaning systems as you go keeps those systems easy to work in, which keeps your teams
moving forward on new features.

## As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no
Need to clarify what is the must-have what what is not

## Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planing time to estimate longer tasks
Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.
However, it's worth spending some time planning more carefully before you commit your team
to a big, unknown project.

## Ask the CTO for estimate

When we join a new small team as a manager, it is tough.
We have new code to learn, make sure you:
- Watching other Pull requests and reviews
- Asking for testing, release process.
