## Blocking I/O, Threading, and Parallelism 

One of the core requirements for creating a working service architecture is

parallelism with requests: asynchronous and multi-thread I/O.

### Asynchronous I/O

Asynchronous I/O is an approach that lets a program continue to execute while waiting
for data.

### Multi-threading
