# The sould of Agenda

Most participants in creation new software are either blissfully ignorant of the past or recklessly confident of the future
- blithely certain that this time things will be different

The mantra that project leaders everywhere offer to try to clear the air of paralyzing memories: This time will be different.

Kapor had started On Technology company after leaving Lotus and finishing Agenda. The project On was building would be impressive
but after a year and a half with virtually nothing to show.

Cutting the size of the company in half and 2 years later, On shipped its first product: an add-on mac Macintosh operating system
and 2 other products. They were critical hits but failed to catch fire.

"There is no such things as a typical software project", Andy HertzField liked to say. "Every project is different."
