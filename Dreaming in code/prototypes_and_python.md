# Prototypes and Python

Programmers so often themseleves fenced in by the tools and materials they work with.
Software is abstract and therefore seem as if it should be infinitely malleable. And yet,
for all its ethereal flexibility, it can be stubbornly,
maddeningly intractable, and it is constantly surprising us with its
rigidity. 

It so often takes ages before a new piece of software is ready for anyone to use, programmers
often test their assumptions against "use case" - hypothetical scenarios about how imaginary people
can might need or want to use program.

"Good programmers know what to write". "Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)."

There is no Moore's Law for software. Chips may double in capacity every year or two. But ours brain don't.

Where compiled languages run programmer's source code through ahead of time to translate it into machine-readable
binary code, intepreted languages perform that translation when you run propram
The source code gets translated line by line by the interpreter and fed to the processor for execution. 
This makes interpreted languages less efficient, since you're always running two programs at once,
the program you want to use and the interpreter. But it's also make them nimbler.

The programmer doesn't have to wait for each code change to be run through the compiler to see whether it worked, 
and the program has the flexibility to respond to changes on the fly.
