# Prototypes and Python

Programmers so often themseleves fenced in by the tools and materials they work with.
Software is abstract and therefore seem as if it should be infinitely malleable. And yet,
for all its ethereal flexibility, it can be stubbornly,
maddeningly intractable, and it is constantly surprising us with its
rigidity. 

It so often takes ages before a new piece of software is ready for anyone to use, programmers
often test their assumptions against "use case" - hypothetical scenarios about how imaginary people
can might need or want to use program.

"Good programmers know what to write". "Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)."
