 To programmers, refactoring
means rewriting a chunk of code to make it briefer, clearer, and easier to
read without changing what it actually does. Refactoring is often compared
to gardening; it is never finished.

In software management, coordination is not an afterthought or an
ancillary matter; it is the heart of the work, and deciding what tools and
methods to use can make or break a project.
