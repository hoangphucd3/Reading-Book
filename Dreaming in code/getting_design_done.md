# Getting Design Done

"Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project,
and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign 
and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or, worse, you might be
scared away by the sheer size of the work you can envision. So start small and think about the details.
Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need,
it's almost certainly overdesigned."
