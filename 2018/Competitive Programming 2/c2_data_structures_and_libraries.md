## 2.1 Overview and Motivation

## 2.2 Data Structures with Built-in Libraries

A data structure is classified as linear if its elements form a sequence.

- Static Array
- Resizeable Array
- Linked List
- Stack
  - Allow insertion (push) and deletion (pop) from the top only.
- Queue
  - Allow insertion (enqueue) from back (tail) and deletion (dequeue) from front (head)
  
  ### 2.2.2 Non-Linear Data Structures
  
  - Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - Heap
    - It is a binary tree like BST but it must be complete.
    - The time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn).
    - heap sort is usually slower than quick sort.
  - Hash table
    - Designing a good performing hash function is quite tricky.
  
  ## 2.3 Data Structures with Our-Own Libraries
  
  ### 2.3.1 Graph
  
  - Adjacency Matrix, usually in the form of 2D array
  - Adjacency List, usually in the form of vector of vector pairs
  - Edge List, usually in the form of vectors of triple
  
  ### 2.3.2 Union-Find Disjoint Sets
  
  It is a data
