Duck types are publc interfaces that are not tied to any specific class.

Duck type objects are defined more by their behavior than by their class.

If an object quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, then its class is immeterial, it's a duk.

## Understanding Duck Typing

### Overlooking the Duck

Complexity is a warning. If sequence diagrams are not simpler than the code they present,
something is wrong in the design.

### Finding the Duck

### Consequences of Duck Typing

It leads through a thicket of complicated, dependent-laden code.

The concreteness makes it simple to understand but dangerous to extend.

Duck type is more abstract, places slightly greated demands on your understading
but in return offers ease of extension.
