The world is procedural.

The world is also object-oriented.

## In praise of design

### Why Change is Hard

Object-oritented applications are made up of parts that interact to produce the behavior of the whole.

The parts are objects; interactions are embodied in the messages that pass between them.

Object-oriented is about managing dependencies.

## A Practival Definition of Design

Every application is a collection of code; the code's arrangement is the design.

You must not write the code for the future you plan to deliver today, you must also create code that is amenable to being changed later.
