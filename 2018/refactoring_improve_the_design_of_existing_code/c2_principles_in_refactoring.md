Don't publish interfaces prematurely. Modify your code ownership policies to smooth
refactoring

## When Shouldn't You Refactor?

- when the existing code is such a mess, it would be easier to start from the beginning.
- When you are close to the deadline.

## Refactoring and Design

```
 "With design I can think very fast, but my thinking is full of little holes."
```
 
- Many people consider design to be the key piece and programming is just mechanics.
- Another scenario, code the first approach that comes into your head, get it working and then refactor it into shape.

The problem with building a flexible solution is that flexibility costs. Flexible
solutions are more complex than simple ones.

 Even if you know exactly what is going on in your system,
measure performance, don't speculate. You'll learn something, and nine
times out of ten, it won't be that you were right!
