## The Basic Tools
Tools amplify your talent. The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more productive you can be.

Start with a basic set of generally applicable tools. As you gain experience, and as you come across special requirements, you’ll add to this basic set. Like the craftsman, expect to add to your toolbox regularly.

## Debugging
No one writes perfect software, so it’s a given that debugging will take up a major portion of your day.

### Psychology of Debugging
It doesn’t really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else’s. It is still your problem.
### A Debugging Mindset
Above all, remember the first rule of debugging:
```
Don’t Panic
```

When trying to solve any problem, you need to gather all the relevant data.
It’s easy to be misled by coincidences, and you can’t afford to waste time debugging coincidences. You first need to be accurate in your observations.

If it took a long time to fix this bug, ask yourself why. Is there anything you can do to make fixing this bug easier the next time around? Perhaps you could build in better testing hooks, or write a log file analyzer. 

Finally, if the bug is the result of someone’s wrong assumption, discuss the problem with the whole team: if one person misunderstands, then it’s possible many people do.
