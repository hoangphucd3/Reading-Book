# Before the Project

At the very beginning of a project, you’ll need to determine the requirements.
Simply listening to users is not enough.

Starting too soon is one problem, but waiting too long may be even
worse.

## The Requirements Pit

```
Don’t Gather Requirements—Dig for Them
```

### Digging for Requirements

A requirement is a statement of something
that needs to be accomplished. Good requirements might include the
following:

- An employee record may be viewed only by a nominated group of people.
- The cylinder-head temperature must not exceed the critical value, which varies by engine.
- The editor will highlight keywords, which will be selected depending on the type of file being edited.

```
Work with a User to Think Like a User
```

The requirements mining process is also the time to start to build a rapport
with your user base, learning their expectations and hopes for the
system you are building.

### Documenting Requirements

#### Use Case Diagrams

Don’t be a slave to any notation; use whatever method
best communicates the requirements with your audience.

#### Overspecifying

A big danger in producing a requirements document is being too specific.
Good requirements documents remain abstract. Where requirements
are concerned, the simplest statement that accurately reflects
the business need is best. This doesn’t mean you can be vague—you
must capture the underlying semantic invariants as requirements, and
document the specific or current work practices as policy.
Requirements are not architecture. Requirements are not design, nor
are they the user interface. Requirements are need.

#### Seeing Further

```
Abstractions Live Longer than Details
